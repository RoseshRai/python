DNA strands have directions!

DNA polymerases are unidirectional: They can only traverse a parent strand in the opposite direction
If you were a DNA Polymerase, how would you replicate a genome?
Wait until the fork opens and replicate...

Single stranded DNA has a much higher mutation rate than double-stranded DNA

DAN replication
Unwinding the DNA: To replicate, the DNA "ladder" first has to untwist and unzip down the middle, like unzipping a zipper. An enzyme called helicase helps to break the bonds between the base pairs, splitting the two strands apart.

Copying in Different Directions:
DNA strands run in opposite directions. One is called the leading strand, and the other is the lagging strand.
The leading strand gets copied continuously because DNA polymerase can add new bases in the same direction as the DNA is being unzipped.
The lagging strand runs in the opposite direction, so it can't be copied continuously. Instead, it is copied in small segments called Okazaki fragments.
RNA Primer: DNA polymerase (the enzyme that adds new DNA bases) can't start on its own. It needs a small starting point called an RNA primer, which is made by the enzyme primase. The RNA primer gives the DNA polymerase a place to begin.

Adding New Bases: On the leading strand, DNA polymerase adds new bases continuously, matching A with T and C with G. On the lagging strand, DNA polymerase works in short bursts, making Okazaki fragments between RNA primers.

Joining Okazaki Fragments: Once all the fragments on the lagging strand are made, another enzyme, called DNA ligase, comes in and "glues" the Okazaki fragments together to form a continuous strand.

Two Identical DNA Molecules: After copying is finished, two identical DNA molecules are formed. Each one has one old strand and one new strand.

Finishing Up: The DNA then twists back into its double-helix shape, and the cell is ready to divide, each new cell getting an exact copy of the DNA.
